Popsicle Selling Game

This Python code simulates a game where you decide how many popsicles to buy for the next day and at what price to sell them. The objective is to maximize your income by attracting customers based on the price you set.

Game Rules

In each day, a random number of customers will be generated.
Each customer is willing to pay a random amount between 1 and 3 dollars.
If the customer's willingness to pay is greater than the selling price, they will buy a popsicle.
You can set the number of popsicles available, the selling price, and the number of customers for each day.
You start with a buying price of 1 dollar for each popsicle.
Running the Game
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the code by executing the script popsicle_game.py in your Python environment.
Follow the prompts to input the number of popsicles you want to buy and the price at which you want to sell each popsicle.
The game will simulate a day of selling popsicles based on your inputs.
You will see the number of customers who purchased popsicles and the income for the day.
Repeat the process by entering new inputs to continue the game.
To quit the game, enter 'q' when prompted for the number of popsicles to buy.
